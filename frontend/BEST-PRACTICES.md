# Angular Best Practices

This document outlines the best practices implemented in this Angular project and provides recommendations for maintaining high code quality and developer productivity.

## Implemented Best Practices

### Project Structure

The project follows a modular architecture with the following structure:

- **Core Module** (`/src/app/core`): Contains singleton services and components that are loaded once in the application.
  - `services/`: Application-wide services
  - `interceptors/`: HTTP interceptors
  - `guards/`: Route guards
  - `models/`: Data models/interfaces

- **Shared Module** (`/src/app/shared`): Contains components, directives, and pipes that are used across multiple feature modules.
  - `components/`: Reusable components
  - `directives/`: Custom directives
  - `pipes/`: Custom pipes

- **Feature Modules** (`/src/app/features`): Contains feature-specific modules, each with their own components, services, etc.

### Code Quality Tools

- **ESLint**: Configured for static code analysis to catch potential issues early.
- **Prettier**: Enforces consistent code formatting across the project.
- **Angular ESLint**: Provides Angular-specific linting rules.

### Environment Configuration

- Environment-specific configuration files in `/src/environments/`
- Separate configurations for development and production environments

### NPM Scripts

Several useful scripts have been added to `package.json`:
- `npm start`: Start the development server
- `npm run build`: Build the application
- `npm run build:prod`: Build the application for production
- `npm run test`: Run unit tests
- `npm run lint`: Run ESLint to check and fix code issues
- `npm run format`: Format code using Prettier
- `npm run format:check`: Check if code is properly formatted

## Additional Recommendations

### State Management

For larger applications, consider implementing state management using NgRx or a similar library to manage application state in a predictable way.

### Testing

- Write unit tests for services and components
- Write integration tests for complex component interactions
- Aim for good test coverage, especially for critical application paths

### Performance Optimization

- Use OnPush change detection strategy for components that don't need frequent updates
- Lazy load feature modules to improve initial load time
- Use trackBy with ngFor to improve rendering performance

### Accessibility

- Ensure the application is accessible by following WCAG guidelines
- Use semantic HTML elements
- Add proper ARIA attributes where needed

### Internationalization (i18n)

If your application needs to support multiple languages, implement Angular's i18n features early in the development process.

### Error Handling

Implement a global error handling strategy using Angular's ErrorHandler to catch and handle errors gracefully.

### Security

- Protect against XSS by avoiding direct DOM manipulation
- Use Angular's built-in sanitization for user-generated content
- Implement proper authentication and authorization mechanisms

### CI/CD

Consider setting up a CI/CD pipeline to automate testing, building, and deployment processes.
